# tdk-tutorial-databases

This repository contains the infrastructure needed to work with [TDK Tutorials](https://docs.synthesized.io/tdk/latest/user_guide/tutorial/configuration)

Simply type `docker-compose run databases` in your favorite terminal, wait for 2-3 seconds, and a Docker whale will report that both databases and preconfigured [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org) have been spun up and are ready for interaction.
